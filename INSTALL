Pre-requisites
==============

mmc-core needs the following to be installed and run:
- php5, with the following modules:
  - xmlrpc
  - gd
- python >= 2.5, with following modules:
  - sqlalchemy >= 0.5
  - mysqldb
  - openssl
  - ldap
- a web server with the following extensions:
  - php5

Furthermore, the following services must be configured:
- ldap, validated with slapd
- mysql

In case you get these sources from the scm, you need the following
to generate the build system:
- autoconf (tested with 2.68)
- automake (tested with 2.11)
- libtool

Quick installation
==================

If you get the code from scm:
$ ./autogen.sh

Then
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var
$ make
$ sudo make install

Install mmc LDAP schema.
- With a slapd using slapd.conf:
  $ sudo cp /usr/share/doc/mmc/contrib/ldap/mmc.schema /etc/ldap/schema/
- With a slapd using LDAP based configuration:
  $ sudo mmc-add-schema /usr/share/doc/mmc/contrib/ldap/mmc.schema /etc/ldap/schema/

Enable mmc in your web server. There is a sample conf file for Apache2, so you
can do:
$ sudo ln -s /etc/mmc/apache/mmc.conf /etc/apache2/conf.d/

`configure' Invocation
======================

   `configure' recognizes the following options to control how it
operates.

`--help'
`-h'
     Print a summary of all of the options to `configure', and exit.

`--help=short'
`--help=recursive'
     Print a summary of the options unique to this package's
     `configure', and exit.  The `short' variant lists options used
     only in the top level, while the `recursive' variant lists options
     also present in any nested packages.

`--version'
`-V'
     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
     script, and exit.

`--cache-file=FILE'
     Enable the cache: use and save the results of the tests in FILE,
     traditionally `config.cache'.  FILE defaults to `/dev/null' to
     disable caching.

`--config-cache'
`-C'
     Alias for `--cache-file=config.cache'.

`--quiet'
`--silent'
`-q'
     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.  To
     suppress all normal output, redirect it to `/dev/null' (any error
     messages will still be shown).

`--srcdir=DIR'
     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.

`--prefix=DIR'
     Use DIR as the installation prefix.  *note Installation Names::
     for more details, including other options available for fine-tuning
     the installation locations.

`--no-create'
`-n'
     Run the configure checks, but stop before creating any output
     files.

`--disable-conf'
     Do not install conf files. On a first install, you may not use this
     option as configuration files are required.

`--disable-conf-backup'
     Do not backup configuration files if they are already installed.
     Default is to create backup files like *.~N~
